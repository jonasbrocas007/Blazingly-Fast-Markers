# Blazingly-Fast-Markers  
Just a test program for me to learn go, i don't know if it's blazingly fast lol  
To go to a link use the go argument  
To append to the list use the append argument  
In windows you can add it to the path, but don't forget to put the full directory of the markers.txt file
insted of just markers.txt in the os.OpenFile function
